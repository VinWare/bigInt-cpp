# bigInt
This is a C++ library that does similar function to the BigInt library in Java.
Numbers of any length can be made as it uses string to store the value.
## How it works
For each opreation, the machine loops over the BigInt string and treat each character as indivisual numbers. Due to the iteration, the time-complexity of operations increase.
